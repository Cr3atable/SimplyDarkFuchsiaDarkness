# SimplyDark - Fuchsia Darkness by Toxxy
A theme for BetterDiscord made by Gibbu. The theme has been completely recolored and lightly re-designed by me.

The theme can contain lots of unintentional bugs/glitches and profanity (clearly meant as jokes)!


To download the theme, follow the next steps:
1. open `SimplyDarkFuchsiaDarkness.theme.css` in the `master` repo up there.
2. click the `Raw` button in the top right corner of the file
3. right click the page, click `Save as...` and save it to your themes folder for BetterDiscord (full installation guide is at the bottom of this readme!)

The link to the original theme is here: https://github.com/Gibbu/BetterDiscord-Themes/tree/master/SimplyDark

Thanks to DevilBro for allowing me to use a part of his theme (BlurpleRecolor) to be added into my SimplyDark variant!

I do not own any part of the code used from BlurpleRecolor!

The theme is specifically made to work on Windows only! Tested on Discord PTB/Canary
