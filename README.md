# SimplyDark - Fuchsia Darkness
A completely re-designed and recolored BetterDiscord theme **SimplyDark** made by **Gibbu**!   
The purpose of the theme is to make discord look black with an accent of choice and compact in it's own way.  
The theme can contain lots of bugs/glitches and profanity (clearly meant as jokes)!

# Settings update! ðŸ’œ
I have taken my time and redone the settings ui! no more need to use an extra theme just to make the theme look beautiful!

## Installation

To download the theme, follow the next steps:
  1. open `SimplyDarkFuchsiaDarkness.theme.css` in the repo.
  2. click the `Raw` button in the top right corner of the theme file page.
  3. once in the "raw" code view; right click the page, click `Save as...` and save it to your BetterDiscord theme folder.
  
   **The theme is specifically made to work on Windows only! Tested on Stable and PTB/Canary**
