# SimplyDark - Fuchsia Darkness
A BetterDiscord theme made by Gibbu, later completely recolored and re-designed by me!  
The theme can contain lots of unintentional bugs/glitches and profanity (clearly meant as jokes)!

## Installation

To download the theme, follow the next steps:
  1. open `SimplyDarkFuchsiaDarkness.theme.css` in the repo.
  2. click the `Raw` button in the top right corner of the theme file page.
  3. once in the "raw" code view; right click the page, click `Save as...` and save it to your BetterDiscord theme folder.
  
   **The theme is specifically made to work on Windows only! Tested on Stable and PTB/Canary**
